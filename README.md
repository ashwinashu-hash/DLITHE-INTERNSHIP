# DLITHE-INTERNSHIP

# Project on Diabetes Prediction

Here in this project i have folllowed 5 basic steps
1.Data Collection
2.Data Analysis
3.Data Processing
4.Algorithm Selection
5.Data Vizualization

--> In Data Collection i have made 9 columns which are necessary for predicting the patient is diabetic or not.Namely,
       a.Pregnancies
       b.Glucose Level
       c.Blood Pressure
       d.Skin Thickness
       e.Insulin Level
       f.Body Mass Index(BMI)
       g.DiabetesPedigreeFunction
       h.Age Of Patient
       e.Outcome to say is patient is diabetic or not
       
 --->DiabetesPedigreeFunction: Diabetes pedigree function (a function which scores likelihood of diabetes based on family history)
       
 ---> The algorithm used for the project is LOGISTIC REGRESSION

                  The above link was used to knw the basic knowlege of diabetes and what are the constraints and what are the limitations.
      ---> Some of the entries are the actual values of various patients around me and some are collected from the various websites.
